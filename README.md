Python ScanSync
===============

This is a Python library that should allow you to use the National Instruments
boxes in the MEG and MRI scanners at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit.
These boxes allow you to sync your experiments with the MRI scanner, to send
triggers to the MEG scanner, and to receive input from button boxes.

The library is written by Edwin Dalmaijer. If you find a bug, have a question, or
just need someone to talk to, please email me: Edwin.Dalmaijer@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk
