# MRC CBU PYTHON SCANNING SYNC
#
# This library is intended to allow for easy communication between Python
# experiments and the MEG and MRI scanners at the MRC Cognition and Brain
# Sciences Unit (CBU). The implementation is intended for the CBU setup only,
# and interfaces with the National Instruments setups in the MEG and MRI labs.
